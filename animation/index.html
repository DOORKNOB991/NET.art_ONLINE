In a pineapple under the sea,
A sponge named Bob, so full of glee.
With friends and adventures, oh so grand,
In Bikini Bottom, a magical land.

His square pants and his bubbly smile,
An oceanic world, where dreams compile.
With Patrick, the starfish, dim but dear,
They navigate waters, far and near.

Jellyfish fields, a glowing delight,
SpongeBob's laughter, a beacon so bright.
Krusty Krab, where patties sizzle,
Under the sea, where dreams sizzle.

Sandy Cheeks, a Texan surprise,
In a water-filled dome, beneath the skies.
Bubbles and squabbles, life's constant dance,
In Bikini Bottom, where seahorses prance.

Plankton's schemes and Squidward's grump,
In the underwater city, where friendships bump.
Yet SpongeBob's spirit, resilient and strong,
Like the tide, it carries him along.

From the Krusty Krab to Goo Lagoon,
In Bikini Bottom, under the moon.
A pineapple house, a snail named Gary,
In this oceanic tale, where joy isn't wary.

So, here's to SpongeBob, the sponge so square,
With laughter and joy, beyond compare.
In the depths of the sea, where corals gleam,
A whimsical world inspired by a sponge's dream.

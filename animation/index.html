       <h1>Chromatic Ballet: Ode to Green and Orange Triangles</h1>    
    <div>
        <p>
        In a palette of hues, vibrant and bright,
Green triangles dance with orange light.
A playful alliance, a visual trance,
Geometry's waltz in a colorful dance.
        </p>
      <p>
       Green, the hue of nature's embrace,
Triangular leaves in a sunlit space.
Emerald canopies, a verdant sea,
In the tapestry of a forest's decree.
        </p>
      <p>
      Orange, a flame in the setting sun,
Triangular warmth when the day is done.
Citrus groves in the evening glow,
A twilight symphony, a nature's show.
        </p>
      <p>
      Triangles entwined, a chromatic fusion,
Green and orange, a visual illusion.
In a kaleidoscope of shapes and shades,
Nature's geometry in quiet cascades.
        </p>
       <p>
     Meadows adorned with green pyramids,
Sunsets painted with orange grids.
A collaboration, a vivid affair,
In the canvas of life, a radiant pair.
        </p>
       <p>
      So, let the triangles twirl and play,
In the realms of color, where they sway.
Green and orange, a visual delight,
Triangles dancing in the soft twilight.
